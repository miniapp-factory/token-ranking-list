#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Generate a concept for a DAO management application that enables decentralized voting, proposal creation, treasury tracking, role permissions, and community engagement. Include interface design, governance models, and security considerations for voting and treasury operations.  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized emblem of a circular network of nodes forming a subtle globe shape, with the letters D and A interwoven at its center, surrounded by a soft gradient background. The design is clean, modern, and conveys decentralization and trust.
